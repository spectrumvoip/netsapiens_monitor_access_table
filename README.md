# netsapiens_monitor_access_table

This php script can be run from crontab to monitor Admin accounts added to your NetSapiens system

It will send an if:

1.	A new Admin User Account is added.
2.	An email address is changed on an existing Admin user.
3.	An existing Admin userâ€™s password is changed.
4.	An Admin user is changed from inactive to active.

I run it from /etc/crontab like so:

# Run every minute to check for changes to NetSapiens access table
#* * *  *  * root /usr/local/scripts/monitor_access_table.php 0

Remove the comment (#) from the above line.

When the script runs, it pulls current info and saves it that data to a file in /tmp.  When it runs again, it pulls current info and compares that info to the file created last time it ran

You should also make it executable:
chmod +x /usr/local/scripts/monitor_access_table.php
