# netsapiens_monitor_access_table

This php script can be run from crontab to monitor Admin accounts added to your NetSapiens system

It will send an if:

1.	A new Admin User Account is added.
2.	An email address is changed on an existing Admin user.
3.	An existing Admin userâ€™s password is changed.
4.	An Admin user is changed from inactive to active.

I run it from /etc/crontab like so:

# Check for changes to access table

#* * *  *  * root /usr/local/scripts/monitor_access_table.php 0

It creates a file in /tmp/ to track differences between the current db and the last time it ran.
